# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch** repository! This repository contains my implementations of various machine learning algorithms, along with explanations, test cases, and example applications. The goal is to solidify my understanding of these algorithms by coding them from scratch and applying them to real-world problems.

## Introduction

This repository is part of my journey to become an expert in machine learning. I am revising fundamental algorithms and implementing them without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms, improve my coding skills, and build a strong foundation for more complex projects.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Supervised Learning

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**

### Unsupervised Learning

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

### Neural Networks

- **Perceptron**
- **Simple Neural Network**

### Others

- **Naive Bayes**
- **Gradient Descent Optimization**

## Getting Started
